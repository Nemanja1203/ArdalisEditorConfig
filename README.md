## Why Indent Size of 2

Code is often shared. Whether in a blog post, on a Slack or Discord channel, on social media, or in a printed book, excessive indentation makes it hard to share code. I hate horizontal scrolling, so I prefer smaller indentation defaults and (when things get long) breaking longer lines so they remain visible without scrolling.

## Changes to original
- Indent size is 4
- Tab size is 4
- Add configuration for Editor Guidelines Extension
